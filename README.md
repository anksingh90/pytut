  ### Practice Questions

  1. **String Length Counter**  
     Write a function `count_characters` that takes a string and returns the number of characters & words in it.
  2. **Maximum Finder**  
     Create a function `find_max` that takes three numbers as parameters and returns the largest one.
  3. **Password Validator**  
     Create a function `is_valid_password` that takes a string and returns `True` if it's at least 8 characters long, `False` otherwise.
  4. **List Average**  
     Create a function `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers and returns their average.
  5. **List Element Finder**  
     Create a function `find_element` that takes a list and a value, returns `True` if the value exists in the list, `False` otherwise.
  6. **String Case Converter**  
     Write a function `toggle_case` that takes a string and returns it with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase and vice versa.
  7. **Function with Default Parameters**  
     Create a function `create_profile` that takes name, age, and city (with default "Unknown") as parameters, and returns a formatted string: `"Name: John, Age: 25, City: Unknown"`.
  8. **List Manipulation with Multiple Returns**  
     Write a function `analyze_numbers` that takes a list of numbers and returns a tuple containing (sum, average, minimum, maximum) of the list.
  9. **Nested Function Implementation**  
     Create a function `math_operations` that contains inner functions for add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The main function should take two numbers and an operator, and use the inner functions accordingly.
  10. **Dictionary Processing Function**  
      Create a function `student_grades` that takes a dictionary of student names and their grades, and returns a new dictionary with only students who have grades above a certain threshold.
