## Question 2: Generates a multiplication table

Write a Python program that generates a multiplication table for a user-specified number and saves it to a file.

### üìã Requirements

#### 1. User Input: Prompt the user to enter an integer.

#### 2. Function for Generation: Create a function named  `generate_multiplication_table(n)`
- This function should take one argument, `n` (the number for the table).
- It should generate the multiplication table for `n` from 1 to 10.
- It must return a list, where each element is a formatted string representing a line of the table (e.g., `5 x 1 = 5\n`). Remember to include a newline character `\n` at the end of each string.

#### 3. File Writing
- In the main part of your script, call the function to get the list of table lines.
- Open a file named `table.txt` in write mode (`w`).
- Use the `file.writelines()` method to write the entire list to the file in one go

#### 4. Confirmation Message
- After writing to the file, print a confirmation message to the user, such as: `Multiplication table of 5 saved in table.txt`.

### üìù Expected Output Format
```
terminal status -
Enter a number: 7
Multiplication table of 7 saved in table.txt

table.txt
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70

```

*Good luck with your implementation! Remember to test your program thoroughly with different inputs.*
