## Question 2: Generates a multiplication table

Write a Python program that generates a multiplication table for a user-specified number and saves it to a file.

### üìã Requirements

#### 1. User Input: Prompt the user to enter an integer.

#### 2. Function for Generation: Create a function named  `generate_multiplication_table(n)`
- This function should take one argument, `n` (the number for the table).
- It should generate the multiplication table for `n` from 1 to 10.
- It must return a list, where each element is a formatted string representing a line of the table (e.g., `5 x 1 = 5\n`). Remember to include a newline character `\n` at the end of each string.

#### 3. File Operations
- Open file `marks.txt` in **write mode**
- For each student record:
  - Write details as comma-separated values
  - Format: `roll_number,name,marks`
  - Example: `101,Rohan,85`
  - Each record on a **new line**

#### 4. Program Termination
- Program exits gracefully when user selects **Option 2**

#### 5. Code Structure Recommendations
- Implement a `get_student_details()` function to handle student data input
- Use write() or writelines() to write
- Use proper error handling for file operations
- Validate user input where appropriate

### üí° Implementation Tips
- Use a `while` loop for the menu system
- Consider input validation for marks (numeric values)
- Handle potential file I/O exceptions
- Provide clear user prompts and feedback

### üìù Expected Output Format
```
marks.txt content example:
Roll No: 101, Name: Ravi, Marks: 89
Roll No: 102, Name: Priya, Marks: 92
Roll No: 103, Name: Aman, Marks: 75
```

*Good luck with your implementation! Remember to test your program thoroughly with different inputs.*
