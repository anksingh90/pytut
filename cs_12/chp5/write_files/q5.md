# üìù Python Programming Question: Student Management System

**Subject:** Computer Science - Python Programming  
**Topic:** File Handling and Menu-driven Programs  
**Time:** 60 minutes 

---

## üéØ Question

**Q1.** Write a complete menu-driven Python program to manage student records using file handling operations. The program should work with a text file named **'student.txt'** to store and retrieve student information.

### üìä Student Record Format:
Each student record contains the following fields:
- **Roll Number** (String)
- **Name** (String) 
- **Address** (String)

**Note:** When storing data in the file, use **comma (,)** as the field separator.

---

## üîß Required Functions

Implement the following functions in your program:

### **Function 1: student_record(filename)**
- **Purpose:** Add new student records to the file
- **Parameters:** filename (string) - name of the file to write to
- **Functionality:**
  - Prompt user to enter student details (roll number, name, address)
  - Append the record to the file in CSV format
  - Display appropriate success/error messages

### **Function 2: student_readdata(filename)**
- **Purpose:** Display all student records from the file
- **Parameters:** filename (string) - name of the file to read from
- **Functionality:**
  - Read all records from the file
  - Display records in a formatted table with headers
  - Handle cases where file doesn't exist or is empty

### **Function 3: student_search(filename)**
- **Purpose:** Search for a student by roll number
- **Parameters:** filename (string) - name of the file to search in
- **Functionality:**
  - Prompt user to enter roll number to search
  - Search through the file for matching record
  - Display complete student details if found
  - Display "not found" message if record doesn't exist

## üìã Menu Requirements

Create a menu-driven interface with the following options:

```
========================================
    STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
========================================
1. Add Student Record
2. Display All Students  
3. Search Student by Roll Number
4. Exit
----------------------------------------
```

### Menu Specifications:
- Display menu repeatedly until user chooses to exit
- Validate user input for menu choices
- Call appropriate functions based on user selection
- Handle invalid menu selections gracefully

---

## üìÅ Additional Requirements

### **File Handling Specifications:**
1. Use proper exception handling for file operations
2. Ensure file is properly opened and closed
3. Handle cases where file doesn't exist initially
4. Use appropriate file modes ('r', 'w', 'a') for different operations

### **Data Storage Format:**
```
Example content of student.txt:
101,John Doe,123 Main Street
102,Jane Smith,456 Oak Avenue  
103,Bob Johnson,789 Pine Road
```

### **Error Handling:**
- Handle file not found errors
- Handle empty file scenarios
- Validate user inputs where necessary
- Display meaningful error messages

## üéØ Sample Program Execution

```
========================================
    STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
========================================
1. Add Student Record
2. Display All Students
3. Search Student by Roll Number  
4. Exit
----------------------------------------
Enter your choice: 1

--- Enter Student Details ---
Enter Roll Number: 101
Enter Name: John Doe
Enter Address: 123 Main Street
Student record added successfully!

Press Enter to continue...

========================================
    STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
========================================
1. Add Student Record
2. Display All Students
3. Search Student by Roll Number
4. Exit
----------------------------------------
Enter your choice: 2

--- Student Records ---
Roll No     Name        Address
------------------------------------------
101         John Doe    123 Main Street
102         Jane Smith  456 Oak Avenue

Press Enter to continue...
```

## üìù Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Marks | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Function Implementation** | 12 | All three functions working correctly |
| **Menu System** | 5 | Proper menu display and navigation |
| **File Handling** | 4 | Correct file operations and error handling |
| **Code Quality** | 2 | Clean code, proper indentation, comments |
| **User Experience** | 2 | User-friendly interface and messages |

---

## üí° Bonus Challenge (Optional - 3 Extra Marks)

Implement an additional function **`student_delete(filename)`** that:
- Allows deletion of a student record by roll number
- Updates the file after deletion
- Handles cases where the record to delete doesn't exist

---

## üìö Hints for Students

1. Use `with open()` statements for automatic file closing
2. Use `split(',')` to separate CSV data when reading
3. Use `os.path.isfile()` to check if file exists
4. Remember to handle newline characters (`\n`) properly
5. Test your program with multiple records to ensure it works correctly

---

**Good Luck! üöÄ**

*Remember to test your program thoroughly with different scenarios including edge cases.*
