## Question 2: Generates all even numbers

Write a Python program that generates all even numbers up to a specified limit N and saves them to a file.

### 📋 Requirements

#### 1. User Input:
  - Prompt the user to enter a positive integer `N`

#### 2. Function Definition
- Create a function named `write_even_numbers(n)` that takes the integer `n` as its parameter.

#### 3. Logic within the function
- Generate a list of all even numbers from 2 up to `n` (inclusive).
- For an efficient solution, use a list comprehension to generate a list of strings, where each string is an even number followed by a newline character (`\n`).
- Open a file named even_numbers.txt in write mode (`w`)
- Use the `file.writelines()` method to write the entire list of numbers to the file

#### 4. Confirmation Message
- After the file is written, print a confirmation message to the console, like `Even numbers from 1 to N saved in even_numbers.txt`.

### 📝 Expected Output Format
```
Console Output -
Enter a number (N): 12
Even numbers from 1 to 12 saved in even_numbers.txt

even_numbers.txt
2
4
6
8
10
12
```
