## Question 4: Student Grades Management System

Write a **menu-driven Python program** to manage student grades with the following specifications:

### üìã Requirements

#### 1. Menu System
Create a continuous menu system with the following options:
- **Option 1:** Add student grades
- **Option 2:** View student grades  
- **Option 3:** Exit

#### 2. Function Implementation

##### 2.1 `get_student_details()` Function
- Prompt user to enter **student name**
- Prompt user to enter **grade** (e.g., A, B+, C, etc.)
- Return formatted string: `"Name: {name}, Grade: {grade}\n"`

##### 2.2 `view_grades()` Function
- Read and display contents from `grades.txt` file
- Handle **FileNotFoundError** exception gracefully
- Display appropriate message if no grades file exists yet

#### 3. File Operations

##### 3.1 Adding Student Grades (Option 1)
- Open `grades.txt` in **append mode**
- Allow user to enter details for **5 students** in one session
- For each student:
  - Display student number (Student 1, Student 2, etc.)
  - Call `get_student_details()` function
  - Write student details to file
- Display confirmation message after saving

##### 3.2 Viewing Student Grades (Option 2)
- Read all data from `grades.txt`
- Display formatted output showing all student grades
- Handle case where file doesn't exist

#### 4. Program Flow
- Use a **while loop** for continuous menu display
- Implement proper input validation for menu choices
- Program terminates only when user selects Option 3
- Display error message for invalid menu selections

### üí° Implementation Guidelines

#### Error Handling
- Use **try-except** blocks for file operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle FileNotFoundError appropriately

#### Code Structure
- Organize code with proper function definitions
- Use clear variable names and meaningful prompts
- Implement clean menu-driven architecture

#### User Experience
- Provide clear instructions and prompts
- Display confirmation messages after operations
- Show appropriate feedback for invalid inputs

### üìù Expected File Format

```
grades.txt content example:
Name: John Doe, Grade: A
Name: Jane Smith, Grade: B+
Name: Mike Johnson, Grade: A-
Name: Sarah Wilson, Grade: B
Name: David Brown, Grade: C+
```

### üéØ Sample Program Execution

```
1. Add student grades
2. View student grades
3. Exit
Enter your choice: 1

Enter details for Student 1:
Enter student name: Alice
Enter grade (e.g., A, B+): A+

Enter details for Student 2:
Enter student name: Bob
Enter grade (e.g., A, B+): B

[... continues for 5 students]

Student grades saved in grades.txt

1. Add student grades
2. View student grades
3. Exit
Enter your choice: 2

Student Grades:
Name: Alice, Grade: A+
Name: Bob, Grade: B
[... shows all saved grades]
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Each session of "Add student grades" will add exactly 5 new students
- Grades are appended to existing file (not overwritten)
- File is created automatically when first student is added
- Program handles missing file gracefully when viewing grades

*Focus on implementing clean, readable code with proper error handling and user-friendly interface!*
